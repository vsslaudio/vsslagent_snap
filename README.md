# vsslagent_snap

# this project holds the files used to generate the vssl snap 

To deploy a new version:
1. get the new binary 'main-linux' from the parakeet project
2. increment the build number in snapcraft.xml
3. make sure the snap builds 'snapcraft' from this dir
4. commit to git.  Launchpad will build the rest...hopefully...
